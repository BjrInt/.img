# dotimg (Work In Progress!)
.img (pronounced “dot image”) is a powerful and versatile, yet easy to use image composer.

## How does it work?
Simply open the directory with your favorite browser (Firefox or Chrome), and launch index.html!

The main idea behind this tool is to provide a complete "clone to go" html interface to create composed pictures such as flyers or promotion materials. Start by putting pictures in your collection, those will appear on thumbnails in the _dotimg interface_. Crop them as will, or apply some effects then put them on your composition to render your picture. You can use presets (image size, disposition, colors, font, ...) to quickly create a series of matching compositions.

### Collection
Your collection stands for all the files that you've added to the browser via the interface

### Settings and presets
(coming soon)

### Composition
(coming soon)

### Preloaded collection
It is possible to add custom pictures to your collection, those pictures will be loaded each time you load the page, thus saving tremendous amount of time working with logos or other type of recurring material.
Simply add pictures in the *presets/collection* directory then push the array in the *presets/collection.js*, it's as simple as that! You can also add custom fonts using the same principle.

Because I mainly work on this for fun in my free time, bugfixes and features development are subject to delays.
